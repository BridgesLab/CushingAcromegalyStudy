## Emont *et al* 2022 http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04518-2

* Code at https://gitlab.com/rosen-lab/white-adipose-atlas
* 5 chow and 5 HFD male mice, 2 chow and 2 HFD female mice.  Performed snRNAseq on inguinal and qhite adopose tissue 
* SRP https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP322736
* Downloaded SRR data into excel file called **emont_mouse_sra_data.csv**.  This is only RNAseq not ATACseq.
