Figure Key
============

This document indicates where the raw data for each Figure panel can be found, and which script was used to generate the data.  Figures were typically made using Rmarkdown files and modified if needed in Adobe Illustrator. The figures are in a folder called figures in the same folder as the script file and are available as both png and pdf files.  In most cases statistical tests and their explanations can be found in the Rmd/md files.
