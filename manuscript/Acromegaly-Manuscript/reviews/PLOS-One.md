Comments to the Author
----------------------

1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?

The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented.

Reviewer #1: No

3. Does the manuscript adhere to the PLOS Data Policy?

Authors must follow the PLOS Data policy <http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing>, which requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction. Please refer to the author’s Data Availability Statement in the manuscript. All data and related metadata must be deposited in an appropriate public repository, unless already provided as part of the submitted article or supporting information. If there are restrictions on the ability of authors to publicly share data—e.g. privacy or use of data from a third party— these reasons must be specified.

Reviewer #1: Yes

4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?

PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.

Reviewer #1: Yes

*Reviewer #1*: The manuscript PONE-D-14-30128 entitled “Gene Expression Signature in Adipose Tissue of Acromegaly Patients” by Hochberg et al. describes the analysis of the adipose tissue transcriptome form acromegaly patients vs. non-functioning adenoma patients, which revealed drastic changes in previously and newly identified targets related to metabolism, insulin and lipid pathways.

The rational of the study seems to be appropriate and well defined; however there are major study and technical limitations that lessen the relevance and impact of the study. It seems that the manuscript do not describe a technically sound piece of scientific research. It is not clear if the experiments have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes.

Regarding the study design, it seems that non-functioning pituitary adenoma patients are not the appropriate controls in this study as they are not normal, healthy controls. Indeed, non-functioning pituitary adenoma patients can present several hormone dysfunctions and other comorbidities that could be impacting adipose tissue biology. In addition, the patients and controls are not age matched; while age has been shown to influence adipose tissue biology. Furthermore, it is not clear if the authors had into account the acromegaly onset, which is crucial to determine the time of high GH exposure.

Regarding the experimental approach, it seems that the authors did not further validate the transcriptomic analysis by qPCR or western-blot, which drastically lessen the reliability of the results. It is neither clear why only 7 out of 9 patients were used for the study. In addition, the study lacks mechanistic studies and/or validations that confirms the direct action of GH on the analyzed genes.

### Other comments:

- Several of the results presented herein (glucose levels, insulin levels, lipolytic measurements) have been previously published by other. However, some of them did not reach statistical significance herein, reflecting the fact that the number of patients and/or replicates could be too low to draw consistent conclusions.
- It is surprising that the authors suggest adipose tissue relevant contribution to IGF plasma levels based on a mere correlation. Have the authors determined which is the real contribution of adipose tissue to IGF levels?
- The authors consistently refer to the effects of excess GH due to acromegaly, while acromegaly also curses with elevated IGF-I levels and therefore both elevated GH and IGF-I levels contribute to the final observed phenotype.
