The data presented in this manuscript was analysed via R scripts.  In this case the raw data cannot be made publically available due to restrictions of the IRB for the Michigan Genomics Initiative (HUM00071298).  These scripts analyse the raw data on a secure server and only output summary-level data and analyses.

The table below indicates the script (R Markdown file) that was compiled for each panel, along with the raw figure.
Figures were then modified using Adobe Illustrator CC  into the file **Figures.ai**, then exported as PNG files.
