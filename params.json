{"name":"Cushingacromegalystudy","tagline":"The source code for the cushing and acromegaly studies, currently ongoing","body":"Code and Raw Data for Acromegaly and Cushing Analyses\r\n========================================================\r\n\r\nThis data was analysed at first on the mbni and felix servers to generate counts tables.  The rest of the analysis was performed locally once the counts table was generated.  See the **processing** folder for the code used in the generation of these alignments and counts tables.\r\n\r\nData Files\r\n------------\r\n\r\nData files are located in the **data** directory\r\nThe raw data in this analysis is located in **data/raw** and is the following files:\r\n\r\n* **patient_table.csv** contains the measured parameters for these patients.\r\n* **patient_legend.txt** describes the units used for measurements in the patient table.\r\n* **patient_sample_mapping.csv** maps the patients to their corresponding samples.\r\n* **transcript_counts_table.csv** has the transcript level counts table.\r\n* **exon_counts_table.csv** has the exon level counts table.  These data has not yet been incorporated into our analysis.\r\n* **acromegaly_patient_IGF1.csv** has the IGF-1 levels for the acromegaly patients.\r\n\r\nData files generated by these scripts are located in the **data/processsed** directory.\r\n\r\nScript Files\r\n---------------\r\nScript files are saved in **scripts** folder and were analysed in this order\r\n\r\n### counts_table_filtering.Rmd\r\n\r\nThis file filters the counts table to show only the most abundant transcript.  It starts with the file **data/raw/transcript_counts_table.csv** and then ends up with **data/processed/filtered_transcript_counts_table.csv.**\r\n\r\n### deseq_analysis_outlier.Rmd\r\n\r\nThis file performs the DESeq analysis both including and removing the one outlier patient who was accidentally included in the analysis.  This script takes the files **data/processed/filtered_transcript_counts_table.csv.** and **data/raw/patient_sample_mapping.csv** and generages annoted DESeq results files for both cushing and acromegaly, as well as lists of statistically significant genes.\r\n\r\n### goseq-analysis.Rmd\r\n\r\nThis script searches KEGG and GO for enriched categories and pathways.  This generates a variety of Gene Ontology Analysis files and the data for Table 2.\r\n\r\n### heatmaps.Rmd \r\n\r\nThis generates the heatmap used in Figure 2.\r\n\r\n## barplots.Rmd\r\n\r\nThis script generates all the barplots used in Figures 3, 4 and Supplementary Figures 1 and 2.\r\n\r\n### acromegaly_clinical_analysis.Rmd\r\n\r\nThis script analyses the clinical characteristics of the groups, generating the table for Table 1 and Figure 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n### GEO_comparasons.Rmd\r\n\r\nThis script compares our significant genes to another similar dataset.  This set treated adipocytes with growth hormone in vitro and did microarrays after 48h of treatment.\r\n\r\n### igf_analysis.Rmd\r\n\r\nThis takes measured IGF-1 levels from acromegaly patients and compares it to *IGF1*  expression from WAT explants.\r\n\r\nFigures\r\n-----------\r\nThe figures generated for the manuscript, via the running of these scripts are in the **figures** directory.  These figures are modified for final publication in the **manuscript** folder using Adobe Illustrator CS6.\r\n\r\nManuscript\r\n------------\r\nThe manuscript files, including the manuscript, the figures, tables and supplementary data are in the **manuscript** directory.  Within this directory are the files generated for uploading the raw and processed data to the Gene Expression omnibus (in the folder **manuscript/GEO_submission**).\r\n","google":"UA-41854373-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
